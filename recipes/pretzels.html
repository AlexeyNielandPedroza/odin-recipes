    <p>
       A pretzel, from German pronunciation, standard German: Breze is a type of baked pastry made from dough that is commonly shaped into a knot. The traditional pretzel shape is a
       distinctive symmetrical form, with the ends of a long strip of dough intertwined and then twisted back onto itself in a particular way. Today, pretzels come in a wide range
       of shapes.
